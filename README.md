# NAMD-MD

This is for a general solution simulation for a RCSB PDB structure with a ligand, with a special foucs on small molecule ligand.
This notebook take http://zarbi.chem.yale.edu/ligpargen/namd_tutorial.html as a general refernce, with an effor to prepare and fix the protein-ligand complex problems at the beginning. Several NAMD conf files example are provided as well, modify them if you need to.
