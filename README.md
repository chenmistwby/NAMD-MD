# NAMD-MD

This is for a general solution simulation for a RCSB PDB structure with a ligand, with a special foucs on small molecule ligand.
This notebook take http://zarbi.chem.yale.edu/ligpargen/namd_tutorial.html as a general refernce

I hope later this notebook could be updated to be able to use independently on colab, but for now, you still need to use it with your local VMD.
