CAUTIONï¼š The notebook example is NOT PERFECT, your need some MODIFICATION in terms of names, file path etc., before you could actually run a simulation.
Especially, for example, modify "input" and "parameter" section inside the confiles before running.

This is for a general solution simulation for a RCSB PDB structure with a ligand, with a special foucs on small molecule ligand.
This notebook take http://zarbi.chem.yale.edu/ligpargen/namd_tutorial.html as a general refernce

You could also use this script to simulate a docked complex, but in that case, more extra work outside of this notebook are supposed to be done, mainly in manuplating the complex.pdb file in a text editing tool such as sublime text, changing the atom numbering and chain name etc.
